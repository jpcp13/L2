    "Python, like most programming languages, comes with a \"mod operation\" `%` to compute remainders.  This makes basic modular arithmetic straightforward.  The more interesting aspects -- from the standpoint of programming and number theory -- arise in **algorithms** related to modular arithmetic.  Here we focus on Pingala's algorithm, a method for computing exponents based on an ancient method for enumerating poetic meters.  We analyze the **expected performance** of this algorithm using Python's `timeit` function for timing and `randint` function to randomize input parameters.  We also see how the performance depends on the number of **bits** of the input parameters.  In this way, we gently introduce some practical and theoretical issues in computer science.\n",

    "For basic modular arithmetic, one can use Python's \"mod operator\" `%` to obtain remainders.  There is a conceptual difference between the \"mod\" of computer programming and the \"mod\" of number theorists.  In computer programming, \"mod\" is typically the operator which outputs the remainder after division.  So for a computer scientist, \"23 mod 5 = 3\", because 3 is the remainder after dividing 23 by 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number theorists (starting with Gauss) take a radical conceptual shift.  A number theorist would write $23 \\equiv 3$ mod $5$, to say that 23 is **congruent** to 3 modulo 5.  In this sense \"mod 5\" (standing for \"modulo 5\") is a [prepositional phrase](https://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2012/08/grammar), describing the \"modular world\" in which 23 is the same as (\"congruent to\") 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect these perspectives, we would say that the computer scientist's statement \"23 mod 5 = 3\" gives the **natural representative** 3 for the number 23 in the mathematician's \"ring of integers mod 5\".  (Here \"ring\" is a term from abstract algebra.)"

They are contained in `__main__` which is the location of all of your other code.

The Python developers have worked hard to make Python run fast -- built-in operations like `**` will almost certainly be faster than any function that you write with a loop in Python.  The developers have written programs in the **C programming language** (typically) to implement operations like `**` (see the [CPython implementation](https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/c7163a7f7cd2/Python/bltinmodule.c#l1505), if you wish); their programs have been **compiled** into **machine code** -- the basic sets of instructions that your computer understands (and that are not meant for people to understand).  When you call a built-in operation like `**`, Python just tells your computer to run the developers' optimized and **precompiled** machine code... this is very fast!
