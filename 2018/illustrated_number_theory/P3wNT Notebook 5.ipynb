    "Python, like most programming languages, comes with a \"mod operation\" `%` to compute remainders.  This makes basic modular arithmetic straightforward.  The more interesting aspects -- from the standpoint of programming and number theory -- arise in **algorithms** related to modular arithmetic.  Here we focus on Pingala's algorithm, a method for computing exponents based on an ancient method for enumerating poetic meters.  We analyze the **expected performance** of this algorithm using Python's `timeit` function for timing and `randint` function to randomize input parameters.  We also see how the performance depends on the number of **bits** of the input parameters.  In this way, we gently introduce some practical and theoretical issues in computer science.\n",

This test can very quickly determine (probabilistically) whether a large (hundreds or thousands of digits!) number is prime.  Our implementation is deterministic for smaller (under 64 bits) numbers.  This programming tutorial complements Chapters 5 and 6 of [An Illustrated Theory of Numbers](http://illustratedtheoryofnumbers.com/index.html).  \n"

    "### The mod (%) operator\n",
    "\n",
    "For basic modular arithmetic, one can use Python's \"mod operator\" `%` to obtain remainders.  There is a conceptual difference between the \"mod\" of computer programming and the \"mod\" of number theorists.  In computer programming, \"mod\" is typically the operator which outputs the remainder after division.  So for a computer scientist, \"23 mod 5 = 3\", because 3 is the remainder after dividing 23 by 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number theorists (starting with Gauss) take a radical conceptual shift.  A number theorist would write $23 \\equiv 3$ mod $5$, to say that 23 is **congruent** to 3 modulo 5.  In this sense \"mod 5\" (standing for \"modulo 5\") is a [prepositional phrase](https://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2012/08/grammar), describing the \"modular world\" in which 23 is the same as (\"congruent to\") 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect these perspectives, we would say that the computer scientist's statement \"23 mod 5 = 3\" gives the **natural representative** 3 for the number 23 in the mathematician's \"ring of integers mod 5\".  (Here \"ring\" is a term from abstract algebra.)"

The second parameter probably looks strange.  It exists because the timeit function sets up a little isolation chamber to run the code -- within this isolation chamber, it only knows standard Python commands and not the new functions you've created.  So you have to *import* your functions (`powermod_1` or `powermod_2`) into its isolation box.  Where are these imported from?  They are contained in `__main__` which is the location of all of your other code.  Finally, the third parameter `number` is the number of times the timeit function will repeat the code (by default, this might be a large number like 1000000).  \n",

    "So the speed difference is not due to the number of mod operations.  But the other issues are relevant.  The Python developers have worked hard to make Python run fast -- built-in operations like `**` will almost certainly be faster than any function that you write with a loop in Python.  The developers have written programs in the **C programming language** (typically) to implement operations like `**` (see the [CPython implementation](https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/c7163a7f7cd2/Python/bltinmodule.c#l1505), if you wish); their programs have been **compiled** into **machine code** -- the basic sets of instructions that your computer understands (and that are not meant for people to understand).  When you call a built-in operation like `**`, Python just tells your computer to run the developers' optimized and **precompiled** machine code... this is very fast!  When you run your own loop, Python is basically converting the code to machine code \"on the fly\" and this is slower.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `pow` function has two versions.  The simplest version `pow(b,e)` raises `b` to the `e` power.  It is the same as computing `b ** e`.  But it also has a modular version!  The command `pow(b,e,m)` raises `b` to the `e` modulo `m`, efficiently reducing modulo `m` along the way."

    "The general strategy behind the Miller-Rabin test then is to use just a few witnesses for smallish potential primes (say, up to $2^{64}$).  For larger numbers, try some number $x$ (like 20 or 50) random bases.  If the tested number **is** composite, then the probability of all witnesses reporting `True` is is less than $1 / 4^x$.  With 50 random witnesses, the chance that a composite number tests as prime is less than $10^{-30}$.  "
